# Hop: Iterative Knowledge Workflow System
## Product Design Document

## 1. Product Overview

Hop is an iterative knowledge workflow system that enables users to build complex workflows through a series of manageable, discrete steps called "hops." Unlike traditional recursive workflow systems that require extensive upfront planning, Hop prioritizes an organic, step-by-step approach that adapts as users progress toward their goals.

Each "hop" represents a mini-workflow that transforms available inputs into valuable outputs through a precise set of steps, developed collaboratively between the user and an AI copilot. Once completed, outputs become available assets for subsequent hops, creating a chain of progressive advancement.

## 2. Core Philosophy

Hop addresses key challenges in knowledge work by:

- **Reducing Planning Overhead**: Users focus on the next achievable step rather than mapping complex workflows entirely upfront
- **Enabling Tangible Progression**: Each hop produces concrete outputs, providing clear indicators of progress
- **Mimicking Natural Discovery**: The system mirrors how humans naturally approach complex knowledge work
- **Optimizing Resource Usage**: Users invest effort only in the next valuable step, based on current insights

## 3. Key Components

### 3.1 Four-Panel Interface

The Hop interface consists of four key panels working in concert:

1. **Chat Pane (Left)**: Primary conversation interface between user and AI copilot for planning, strategizing, and discussing workflow goals.

2. **Workflow Collaboration Space (Center-Left)**: Area for defining, visualizing, and executing "hops," including:
   - Input/output asset specification
   - Step definition and execution
   - Progress tracking
   - Next hop planning

3. **Asset Library (Center-Right)**: Repository of all available resources, showing:
   - Input assets (user-provided resources)
   - Output assets (generated by completed hops)
   - Planned assets (expected from future hops)
   - Filtering and organization tools

4. **Asset Inspector (Right)**: Detailed view for examining and interacting with specific assets:
   - Content preview
   - Metadata display
   - Configuration options
   - Usage planning for subsequent hops

### 3.2 Workflow Methodology

Hop employs an iterative, progressive workflow model:

1. User discusses goals with AI copilot in the Chat Pane
2. Together, they define a concrete "hop" with clear inputs, outputs, and steps
3. The hop is executed step-by-step, with progress visible in the Workflow Collaboration space
4. Outputs are automatically added to the Asset Library
5. User and AI collaborate to plan the next logical hop
6. Process repeats until overall goal is achieved

## 4. Technical Components

### 4.1 Asset Representation

Hop represents workflow assets with a flexible model supporting diverse knowledge resources:

```
{
  "id": "unique_identifier",
  "type": "file|primitive|object",
  "subtype": "specific_format_or_schema",
  "is_collection": true|false,
  "collection_type": "array|map|set|null",
  "content": "actual_data_or_reference",
  "metadata": { additional contextual information }
}
```

### 4.2 Hop Structure

Each hop contains:

- **Title**: Clear identifier for the hop's purpose
- **Input Assets**: Resources required from Asset Library
- **Output Assets**: Resources that will be produced
- **Steps**: Sequence of actions to transform inputs to outputs
- **Status**: Current state of the hop (planning, in progress, completed)

## 5. User Experience Flow

1. **Planning Phase**
   - User discusses needs with AI copilot in Chat Pane
   - Together they define the purpose of the first hop
   - They specify input/output assets and required steps

2. **Execution Phase**
   - Steps are executed in sequence (manually or automatically)
   - Progress is tracked visually
   - New assets are generated and added to library

3. **Review & Planning Phase**
   - Completed hop outputs are examined in Asset Inspector
   - User and AI discuss results and next objectives
   - Next hop is planned based on available assets

4. **Iteration**
   - Process repeats with subsequent hops building on previous results
   - Asset Library grows as workflow progresses
   - Complex goals are achieved through cumulative progress

## 6. Development Priorities

1. Implement the four-panel UI layout with responsive design
2. Develop the asset representation system and library management
3. Create the workflow collaboration interface for hop definition and execution
4. Integrate AI copilot functionality for collaborative planning
5. Implement asset inspection and visualization capabilities

## 7. Use Cases

Hop is designed for knowledge workers tackling complex tasks that benefit from a progressive approach:

- Research projects requiring multiple stages of analysis
- Content development involving collaborative refinement
- Data analysis pipelines with intermediate processing steps
- Decision-making processes requiring evidence gathering and evaluation
- Any knowledge work that benefits from exploratory, progressive refinement
