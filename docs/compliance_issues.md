# Mission State Transition Compliance Issues

## 1. Mission Creation Tests

### Asset Validation Issues
- ❌ No validation that input/output assets have unique IDs
- ❌ No explicit validation that asset types match their declared purposes
- ❌ Asset metadata validation is incomplete - missing validation of required metadata fields

### State Initialization Issues
- ✅ Mission state is properly initialized as empty object
- ✅ Mission status is correctly set to PENDING
- ✅ Hop status is properly undefined for new missions
- ✅ Current hop index is correctly initialized to 0
- ✅ Hops array is properly initialized as empty

### Metadata Validation Issues
- ❌ No validation of success_criteria being non-empty
- ❌ No validation of required mission fields (id, name, description, goal) completeness
- ✅ Created_at and updated_at timestamps are properly set
- ✅ Metadata object exists

## 2. Hop Creation Tests

### Asset Mapping Validation Issues
- ❌ No validation that input_mapping keys exist in mission state
- ❌ No validation of input_mapping values against valid asset IDs
- ❌ No validation of output_mapping key uniqueness
- ❌ No validation of output_mapping values against valid asset IDs
- ❌ No validation that mapped assets exist in mission state

### Hop State Management Issues
- ❌ Hop state initialization with mapped assets is incomplete
- ✅ Status is properly set to PENDING
- ✅ is_resolved is correctly set to false
- ✅ current_step_index is properly set to 0
- ✅ steps array is properly initialized as empty

### Hop Metadata Issues
- ❌ No validation of required hop fields (id, name, description)
- ✅ Created_at and updated_at timestamps are properly set
- ✅ is_final flag is properly set

## 3. Hop Resolution Tests

### Tool Step Validation Issues
- ❌ No validation of tool_id against available tools
- ❌ No validation of parameter_mapping references in hop state
- ❌ No validation of result_mapping references in hop state
- ✅ Step status is properly set to PENDING
- ✅ Created_at and updated_at timestamps are properly set

### Asset Resolution Issues
- ❌ No validation of parameter_mapping assets in hop state
- ❌ No validation of result_mapping assets in hop state
- ❌ No validation of asset types against tool requirements
- ❌ No validation of collection type handling
- ❌ No validation of asset metadata preservation

### State Updates Issues
- ✅ is_resolved is properly set to true
- ✅ Status is properly updated to HOP_READY_TO_EXECUTE
- ✅ hop_status in mission is properly updated
- ✅ current_hop_index is properly updated
- ❌ No validation of mission state updates with hop outputs

## 4. Cross-Transition Tests

### Mission State Consistency Issues
- ❌ No validation that mission state contains all input assets
- ❌ No validation that mission state contains all hop outputs
- ❌ No validation for duplicate asset IDs in mission state
- ❌ No validation of asset reference validity across transitions
- ❌ No validation of metadata consistency across transitions

### Hop Sequence Validation Issues
- ❌ No validation of hops array order against execution sequence
- ❌ No validation of current_hop_index validity
- ❌ No validation of hop dependencies
- ❌ No validation of final hop marking
- ❌ No validation of hop status transitions

### Asset Lifecycle Issues
- ❌ No validation of asset creation in mission state
- ❌ No validation of asset mapping in hops
- ❌ No validation of asset updates by tool steps
- ❌ No validation of final assets against output specifications
- ❌ No validation of asset metadata maintenance

## Critical Missing Validations

1. Asset ID Uniqueness
   - No validation to ensure unique IDs across all assets
   - No validation to prevent ID collisions between inputs, outputs, and hop assets

2. Asset Type Compatibility
   - No validation that asset types match their intended use
   - No validation of type compatibility between tools and assets

3. State Consistency
   - No validation of state consistency across transitions
   - No validation of asset reference integrity

4. Metadata Integrity
   - Incomplete validation of required metadata fields
   - No validation of metadata consistency across transitions

## Implementation Priorities

1. High Priority
   - Asset ID uniqueness validation
   - Asset type compatibility checks
   - State consistency validation
   - Required field validation

2. Medium Priority
   - Metadata integrity validation
   - Hop sequence validation
   - Asset lifecycle validation

3. Low Priority
   - Cross-transition validation
   - Edge case handling
   - Performance optimizations
