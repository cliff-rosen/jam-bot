# Orchestrator Platform
## Product Specification for Proof of Concept

### 1. Executive Summary
Orchestrator is a platform for designing, running, and managing structured AI workflows. It enables users to compose powerful AI-powered solutions without coding, while maintaining control and transparency over the process. The platform sits between low-level programming and black-box AI agents, offering the right balance of power and usability.

The platform enables users to:
- Design repeatable AI workflows without coding
- Swap different models and tools without re-engineering
- Build high-level strategies from lower-level prompt steps
- Manage iterations, feedback loops, and evaluation cycles
- Share, save, and reuse workflow components
- Visualize the journey from input to output
- Maintain observability into workflow execution
- Bridge from prototype to production

### 1.1 Journey-Oriented Interaction
Unlike traditional chat interfaces that focus on threaded conversations, Orchestrator is fundamentally journey-oriented. A journey represents a complete workflow solution - from initial goal to final deliverable. This key distinction means:

- Every conversation starts by defining a journey - establishing the workflow's purpose, inputs, and desired outputs
- The AI copilot helps design and execute workflows by:
  - Breaking down goals into structured steps
  - Suggesting appropriate tools and models
  - Managing workflow state and progress
  - Providing context-aware assistance
- Multiple journeys can exist in parallel, each representing a distinct workflow
- The system maintains transparency by:
  - Tracking workflow state and progress
  - Showing inputs/outputs at each step
  - Enabling inline testing and iteration
  - Providing observability into execution

This journey-oriented approach ensures that every interaction contributes to building and executing structured, repeatable AI workflows.

### 2. Core Concepts

#### 2.1 Journey
- A structured, goal-driven collaboration between the user and the system's AI copilot
- Starts with a user intention and ends with a deliverable
- Example: "Summarize client feedback on new pricing model"

#### 2.2 Deliverable
- The desired outcome or output of a journey
- Can be a summary, draft, report, structured dataset, visual, decision, or action plan
- Example: "A slide with 3–5 summarized insights"

#### 2.3 Workflow
- The sequence of actions (steps) required to produce the deliverable
- Can be dynamically generated, suggested by the copilot, or created manually
- Example: "Search Emails → Extract Feedback → Cluster Themes → Draft Slide"

#### 2.4 Step
- A discrete unit of work in a workflow
- Uses tools or agents, produces results, and updates the asset space
- Example: "Run Email Search agent for 'pricing' threads"

#### 2.5 Copilot
- An AI assistant embedded in the journey
- Converses with the user
- Proposes workflows
- Suggests tools
- Runs agents
- Reflects on results

#### 2.6 Agent
- A callable, intelligent actor that performs tasks using tools, data, and rules
- Can be reused across journeys and steps
- Example: EmailSearchAgent, FeedbackExtractorAgent

#### 2.7 Tool
- A function, template, or service that performs a specific operation
- Typically stateless
- Can be invoked directly or wrapped by agents
- Example: Prompt template, document chunker, vector search

#### 2.8 Asset
- Any intermediate or final output relevant to the journey
- Shared among user, copilot, tools, and agents
- Example: A list of extracted feedback, a JSON file, a PDF, a saved prompt

### 3. Interface Components

#### 3.1 Journey Card
**Purpose**: Represents a complete workflow solution
- Title and goal description
- Status and progress indicator
- Creator and timeline information
- Tags for categorization
- Sharing and collaboration controls

#### 3.2 Chat Interface
**Purpose**: Primary interface for user-Copilot collaboration
- Threaded conversation history
- Rich message formatting
- Context-aware suggestions
- @mentions for assets and tools
- Message reactions and bookmarks
- Conversation branching

#### 3.3 Workflow Viewer
**Purpose**: Visualizes the execution plan and progress
- Sequential step visualization
- Current progress indicator
- Drag-and-drop step reordering
- Step details and parameters
- Execution controls (run, pause, revert)
- Branching and conditional paths

#### 3.4 Asset Panel
**Purpose**: Manages all resources used in the workflow
- Input files and documents
- Generated outputs and results
- Versioning and history
- Metadata and tagging
- Preview and quick-edit capabilities
- Import/export functionality

#### 3.5 Workspace
**Purpose**: Central area for viewing and editing content
- Multi-format content display
- Interactive data visualizations
- Split-view for comparing results
- Customizable layouts and panels
- Context-sensitive toolbars
- In-place editing capabilities

#### 3.6 Agent Panel
**Purpose**: Access to specialized AI tools for specific tasks
- Searchable agent directory
- Capability descriptions and requirements
- Configuration options and parameters
- Usage analytics and performance metrics
- Favorites and recently used list
- Custom agent creation

### 3.7 Sequence of Operations
**Purpose**: Document the standard flow of user-system interaction

1. **Journey Creation**
   - User requests new journey
   - System displays proposed journey card
   - User accepts → journey card moves to top of display area

2. **Workflow Proposal**
   - System offers to propose workflow
   - User selects "propose workflow"
   - Workflow proposal window appears
   - User accepts → workflow appears in workflow area

3. **Step Execution**
   - System announces preparation of first tool/agent
   - System indicates tool is ready with continue option
   - Current step area updates with tool and step details
   - User accepts to continue
   - Tool status changes to active
   - System announces tool is running
   - Tool completes execution
   - Current step updates with output as draft asset
   - System describes output and offers to add to assets
   - User accepts asset
   - Workflow updates to show step completion
   - Assets panel updates with new asset

4. **Next Step Transition**
   - System proposes next tool
   - System confirms tool selection
   - Workflow area highlights next step
   - Step detail area updates with new tool and details
   - Process repeats from Step Execution

This sequence ensures a clear, guided experience while maintaining user control and system transparency at each stage.
