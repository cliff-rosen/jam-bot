acknowledges \u2018ugly and embarrassing\u2019 Siri delays\nLINK\nRobby Walker, Apple's Senior Director of Siri and Information Intelligence, criticized the delay of new Siri features as \"ugly and embarrassing\" during a company-wide meeting.\nThe postponed Siri updates, such as on-screen awareness and personal context, are not expected until at least 2026, with no specific release date confirmed by Walker.\nWalker expressed the need for significant improvements to make Siri a leading virtual assistant, acknowledging that current features fall short of expectations and could require complete re-engineering.\n\ud83e\udd16 Google is officially dumping Assistant for Gemini\nLINK\nGoogle is replacing its Assistant with the AI-powered Gemini, which aims to offer a more personalized and interactive experience with existing apps and services.\nThe transition from Google Assistant to Gemini will occur on mobile devices over the coming months, with the classic Assistant becoming inaccessible on most mobile platforms by the end of the year.\nGemini, now available in over 40 languages and 200 countries, introduces advanced features such as Gemini Live for dynamic conversations and Deep Research as a personal research aide.\n\ud83d\udd0a Alexa voice recordings always sent to Amazon now\nLINK\nAmazon will end the feature that allowed some Echo devices to process Alexa requests locally instead of sending voice recordings to the cloud on March 28th, 2025.\nThis change is linked to the introduction of the generative AI-powered Alexa Plus, which relies on cloud processing to enhance Alexa's capabilities.\nWhile local processing will no longer be an option, users can still choose to have their voice recordings deleted after cloud processing, ensuring their privacy preferences are maintained.\n\ud83e\udee0 Deepseek restricts employee travel amid AI security concerns\nLINK\nDeepseek employees involved in AI model development must hand over their passports, restricting their ability to travel internationally, though it is unclear if this mandate comes from the company or Chinese authorities.\nIn Zhejiang province, officials screen potential investors before meetings with Deepseek to prevent data leaks and unauthorized takeovers, contrasting with the company's image as a proponent of open-source AI.\nChinese government concerns about national security and economic threats have led to warnings for AI executives against U.S. travel, fearing data leaks and the detention of key personnel as diplomatic leverage.\n\ud83d\ude80 SpaceX launches astronauts for long-awaited International Space Station crew swap\nLINK\nSpaceX launched four astronauts on a mission to the International Space Station, which will facilitate the return of Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore after a nine-month stay.\nThe Crew-10 mission involves SpaceX\u2019s Dragon spacecraft docking with the ISS, where the new crew will temporarily overlap with the current team before Williams and Wilmore return to Earth around March 19.\nThe mission gained attention due to the extended stay of Williams and Wilmore, initially sent via Boeing\u2019s Starliner, which faced technical issues, delaying their return and leading to Musk's unverified claims about political interference.\nFROM OUR PARTNER\nLumen is the world\u2019s first handheld metabolic coach

regulatory hurdles, expressing concerns about competition from Chinese AI firms and proposing a voluntary collaboration with the federal sector.\nThe company advocated for a faster approval process for AI tools used by federal agencies, emphasizing the need for a temporary waiver to bypass current certification requirements, which it claims will expedite AI integration by up to a year.\nOpenAI suggested closer government partnerships with private AI companies for national security purposes and recommended banning Chinese AI models like DeepSeek's, citing potential security risks and intellectual property concerns.\n\ud83d\udd12 Apple to support encrypted RCS messaging with Android\nLINK\nApple and Android devices will soon be able to exchange encrypted RCS messages, following updates to the RCS specifications announced by the GSM Association.\nThe new RCS standard, which includes end-to-end encryption based on the Messaging Layer Security protocol, was developed with the help of mobile operators, device manufacturers, and tech providers.\nApple plans to implement support for encrypted RCS messages across its various operating systems in future updates, enhancing privacy and security for users exchanging texts with different platforms.\n\ud83e\ude90 Nvidia names new chips after Vera Rubin, woman who discovered dark matter\nLINK\nNvidia is set to unveil its

matter and advocated for women in science, making her a fitting namesake for Nvidia's next-generation chip platform.\nNvidia has a tradition of naming its GPU architectures after renowned scientists, aiming to achieve recognition similar to its previous platforms, such as Hopper and Blackwell, in the tech industry.\n\ud83d\udd0a AirPods to get live translation feature\nLINK\nApple plans to introduce a live translation feature to AirPods later this year, allowing users to hear translations of other languages directly through their earbuds.\nThe new translation capability will be part of a software update tied to iOS 19 and will work with existing AirPods models, eliminating the need for special hardware.\nApple's live translation feature comes after similar offerings from competitors like Google, whose Pixel Buds have provided real-time language conversion for several years.\n\ud83d\udd0d Oracle could end up running TikTok\nLINK\nTikTok is considering a partnership with Oracle as its American cloud technology partner as it seeks to secure its future in the United States.\nThe social media platform must sell to a US-based company by April 2025 to continue its operations in the country, although it's uncertain if an agreement will be reached by then.\nOracle, led by CEO Larry Ellison, who is a known ally of former President Donald Trump, has been providing cloud services to TikTok since 2022, making it a potential candidate for managing the app's US operations.\nFROM OUR PARTNER\nInnovating with AI\u2019s new program\n, AI Consultancy Project, trains AI enthusiasts with

Raise your hand if your crew needs this. \u270b\nGoogle give robots a new kind of intelligence\nVia Google\nIs a robot takeover just around the corner? Google DeepMind\u2019s new AI models, Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER, are\ndesigned\nto help robots understand and interact with the physical world\u2014even in situations they\u2019ve never encountered before.\nSmarter bots:\nWith the AI models, robots can generalize new situations, interact more naturally with humans, and handle delicate tasks like folding a piece of paper or unscrewing a bottle cap\u2014things that previously required meticulous pre-programming.\nGemini Robotics-ER adds embodied reasoning, allowing robots to think through multi-step tasks.\nWhy it matters:\nRobotics has long struggled with adaptability\u2014most systems are rigid and pre-trained for specific functions. Gemini Robotics marks a shift toward robots that can respond dynamically to real-world environments.\nWhat\u2019s cooking at Meta?\nAI chips.\nMeta is reportedly\ntesting\nits own AI training chips, aiming to reduce dependence on Nvidia and other third-party suppliers. If successful, Meta would have more control over AI innovation and save billions in costs.\nChips power the AI race:\nAI models need massive computing power to train effectively. Meta\u2019s new chip, built with TSMC, is still in pilot testing. But if it performs well, Meta could bring more AI operations in-house and break free from Nvidia\u2019s supply chain dominance.\nBig picture:\nThe future of AI isn\u2019t just software\u2014it\u2019s who owns the processing power. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have already developed custom AI chips, and Meta doesn\u2019t want to be left behind.\nTurn voice into text\nVia Letterly\nLetterly\nis an AI-powered mobile app that transforms speech into text with multiple rewrite options.\nHow you can use it:\nDictate emails, reports, or essays instead of typing\nInstantly refine spoken drafts into clear, professional text\nTranslate speech into different languages\nSave and sync notes across devices\nPricing: Free with premium options\nClick here to try\nData analysis, simplified\nVia Powerdrill AI\nPowerdrill AI\nlets you analyze complex datasets without coding, using natural language queries to create instant visualizations.\nHow you can use it:\nGenerate charts and reports automatically\nAsk complex data questions in plain English\nSpot trends and insights without manual effort\nPricing: Free plan avaliable; Basic tier starts at $3.90/month\nGive it a whirl\nEvery AI model in one chat box\nVia TypethinkAI\nWhy choose one AI when you can compare GPT-4, Claude, and others in real time?\nTypethinkAI\nlets you toggle between models for more refined results.\nWays to use it:\nCross-check responses from different models\nUse real-time web search for up-to-date insights\nGenerate, refine, and fact-check content all in one place\nPricing: Free with premium options\nTry it out here\nJobs, announcements, and big ideas\nOpenAI\ncalls\nfor ban on DeepSeek and China AI models.\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet\ngets\nfaster with fewer tokens.\nJoin Scale AI as a\nContent Strategist\nfor contributor operations.\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel Sense AI assistant is\ncoming\n.\nAnthropic\u2019s\nprotocol\nis an AI Rosetta Stone.\nOracle\u2019s AI agents\ntarget\nfinancial crime.\nNvidia\nlevels\nup AI rendering at GDC 2025.\n4 steps to AI startup success:\nVijoy Pandey joins The Next Wave to reveal the blueprint for 10x\u2019ing your AI business.\nCisco SVP: The 4-Step Blueprint To Building a Successful AI Startup\nThat\u2019s a wrap!\nThanks for being here.

Google DeepMind\u2019s new AI models, Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER, are [designed](https://www.theverge.com/news/628021/google-deepmind-gemini-robotics-ai-models) to help robots understand and interact with the physical world\u2014even in situations they\u2019ve never encountered before.\r\n\r\n**Smarter bots:\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* With the AI models, robots can generalize new situations, interact more naturally with humans, and handle delicate tasks like folding a piece of paper or unscrewing a bottle cap\u2014things that previously required meticulous pre-programming.\r\n\r\n* Gemini Robotics-ER adds embodied reasoning, allowing robots to think through multi-step tasks.\r\n\r\n\u201c**Why it matters: **Robotics has long struggled with adaptability\u2014most systems are rigid and pre-trained for specific functions. Gemini Robotics marks a shift toward robots that can respond dynamically to real-world environments.\u201c \u2014 \r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n### **What\u2019s cooking at Meta?**\r\n\r\n**AI chips. **Meta is reportedly [testing](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/meta-is-reportedly-testing-in-house-chips-for-ai-training/) its own AI training chips, aiming to reduce dependence on Nvidia and other third-party suppliers. If successful, Meta would have more control over AI innovation\u00a0and save billions in costs.\r\n\r\n**Chips power the AI race: **AI models need massive computing power to train effectively. Meta\u2019s new chip, built with TSMC, is still in pilot testing. But if it performs well, Meta could bring more AI operations in-house and break free from Nvidia\u2019s supply chain dominance.\r\n\r\n\u201c**Big picture: **The future of AI isn\u2019t just software\u2014it\u2019s who owns the processing power. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have already developed custom AI chips, and Meta doesn\u2019t want to be left behind.\u201c \u2014 \r\n\r\n\r\n----------View image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/4e6f0e0e-9fee-4b02-8897-b60c3fd302e3/1127_Header_v3_Line.png?t=1701202264)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/60c0225b-3f71-4e08-9209-27879f3b027d/Blue_Red_Comic_Creative_Versus_YouTube_thumbnail__1_.png?t=1737124779)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n----------\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/7f521ea1-30b7-4d20-be99-671d5239ca3a/image.png?t=1732716754)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n### **Turn voice into text**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/c6b2dc76-51d8-4527-9c86-5d82ca4dc641/image.png?t=1741917235)\r\nCaption: Via Letterly\r\n\r\nLetterly is an AI-powered mobile app that transforms speech into text with multiple rewrite options.\r\n\r\nHow you can use it:\r\n\r\n* Dictate emails, reports, or essays instead of typing\r\n\r\n* Instantly refine spoken drafts into clear, professional text\r\n\r\n* Translate speech into different languages\r\n\r\n* Save and sync notes across devices\r\n\r\n_Pricing: Free with premium options_\r\n\r\nClick here to try (https://letterly.app/?ref=futuretools.io)\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/92d998de-971f-469e-adde-fa11d16b0e0d/Untitled-2__3_.png?t=1701809755)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n### **Data analysis, simplified**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5833e635-25e4-424e-a40c-d9eb7837edad/cropped_6de3cf7b-2af5-458b-b9d6-b013eedd67c7_1741961391164.png?t=1741961392)\r\nCaption: Via Powerdrill AI\r\n\r\n**Powerdrill AI **lets you analyze complex datasets without coding, using natural language queries to create instant visualizations.\r\n\r\n**How you can use it:**\r\n\r\n* Generate charts and reports automatically\r\n\r\n* Ask complex data questions in plain English\r\n\r\n* Spot trends and insights without manual effort\r\n\r\n_Pricing: Free plan avaliable; Basic tier starts at $3.90/month_\r\n\r\nGive it a whirl (https://powerdrill.ai/?ref=futuretools.io)\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/cec846dd-4228-4bdb-a6ec-61f41ec9fd37/PRODUCTIVITY.png?t=1701809762)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n### **Every AI model in one chat box**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/8751ef7c-c7a1-418c-a0f3-d34896370888/image.png?t=1741917134)\r\nCaption: Via TypethinkAI\r\n\r\nWhy choose one AI when you can compare GPT-4, Claude, and others in real time?

DeepSeek\n\ud83d\udea8\nOur Report \u2014\nAs part of its submission for the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cAI Plan\u201d initiative, OpenAI has described its rival, Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek, as \u201cstate-sponsored\u201d and \u201cstate-controlled\u201d and has urged the government to ban its models\u2014including the viral reasoning model, R1\u2014and all other models produced by companies that are backed by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\n\ud83d\udd13 Key Points:\nOpenAI believes that DeepSeek and other PRC models pose a US security risk because the\nChinese government can demand companies share user data upon request and use it to cause harm.\nIt wants PRC-produced AI models to be banned in all countries classified as \u201cTier 1\u201d under the Biden administration's export rules (18 of the US' most trusted allies) to\nprotect privacy, prevent security risks, and stop IP theft\n.\nBut DeepSeek\u2019s open models\u2014used by Microsoft, Perplexity, and Amazon\u2014\ndon\u2019t allow the Chinese government to siphon users' data\n, leaving many questioning the practicality of the potential ban.\n\ud83d\udd10\nRelevance \u2014\nThere is also no clear link between the Chinese government and DeepSeek (although DeepSeek\u2019s founder, Liang Wenfeng, did recently meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, raising speculations about the company\u2019s political ties), leaving many believing that this is just a tactic from OpenAI to limit DeepSeek\u2019s influence.\nFull Story\nIs this a powerplay tactic from OpenAI or a consideration that needs to be taken seriously?\n\ud83d\udfe7 It\u2019s a tactic to weaken the competitive threat from DeepSeek\n\ud83d\udfe8 It\u2019s a legitimate concern that needs to be considered by the

\u2014\nAlongside OpenAI, Google has also submitted a proposal in response to Trump's request for a national \u201cAI Plan,\u201d with the central, core message being that the US needs to aggressively prioritize AI innovation over regulation, because it believes that \u201cfor too long, AI policymaking has paid disproportionate attention to the risks, often ignoring the costs that misguided regulation can have on innovation, national competitiveness, and scientific leadership.\u201d\n\ud83d\udd13 Key Points:\nTwo of the biggest areas of change that Google is advocating for are weaker copyright restrictions and balanced export controls that\ndon\u2019t stifle international business and the export of US AI technologies.\nGoogle wants \u201cfair use\u201d and \u201ctext-and-data mining exceptions\u201d to be applied to all AI training data and the\nright to train AI models on publicly available data, including copyrighted material, with minimal restrictions.\nIt also thinks that AI chip export restrictions under Biden imposed \u201cdisproportionate burdens\u201d and, while\nlimiting the availability of AI chips in disfavored countries, wants exemptions for trusted businesses.\n\ud83d\udd10\nRelevance \u2014\nGoogle is clearly favoring innovation over risk\u2014arguing that previous AI polices have been \u201coverly focused\u201d on risks\u2014and believes the \u201ccurrent administration is starting to correct this imbalance,\u201d but one can\u2019t help but think that these proposals come as it faces several lawsuits accusing it of training its AI models on copyrighted data without permission or awarding any compensation, so if these rules are passed, does that mean Google escapes without any consequences? If so, is that right or wrong?\nFull Story\nIf weaker copyright rules are passed and Google escapes its copyright lawsuits, is that right or wrong?\n\ud83d\udfe9 Right\n\ud83d\udfe5 Wrong\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014 \u2014\n\ud83e\udd77\nBail granted to NVIDIA chip smugglers\nEarlier this month, two Singaporean men and one Chinese man were arrested by Singaporean authorities for\nsmuggling $390M worth of NVIDIA Blackwell chips out of the US despite US export restrictions.\nThe Singapore courts have now\ngranted the three men bail (for between S$600K to S$1M)\nwith the next court hearing scheduled for May 2nd, after prosecutors asked for 8 weeks to complete their investigation.\nThe Chinese man must wear an electronic tagging device, and\nall three have been banned from airports and border checkpoints and prohibited from discussing the case if they are released on bail.\nFull Story\n\u2014 \u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014 \u2014\nTOGETHER WITH\nARAGON AI\nTry out the #1 AI headshot generator\nImprove your personal brand and land more job opportunities and clients with Aragon, the #1 AI headshot generator\u2014\nrated 4.8/5 stars and trusted by over 1.3M professionals.\nJust upload a few photos of yourself and get back 100 incredible headshots in minutes.\nDon't waste hundreds of $$$ on an in-person photoshoot.\nBacked by top investors,\nAragon's proprietary AI generate the most realistic headshots on the market.\nIn fact, in a study done with 1,087 recruiters,\n76.5% preferred Aragon.ai's headshots over people's existing photos!\nGet your headshots now\nTRENDING AI TOOLS\nVanta\n:\nAutomate up to 90% of compliance for SOC 2, ISO 27001, and more \u2014 get $1,000 off\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 / 5 (G2)\nChatNode\nis for building custom, advanced AI chatbots that enhance customer support and user engagement\nTufa\nis\nan AI tool that streamlines social media management\nPRACTICAL AI\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\nPrompt Inspiration\nAfter typing this prompt, you will get a contingency plan for issues like supplier failures or natural disasters.\nP.S.

The feature will allow users to hear a translated version of speech through their AirPods - their iPhones will play a translation from its speakers if the user responds. In addition to the feature, Apple plans to overhaul the design of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS this year.

Its next critical AI chip platform will be named after Vera Rubin, an American astronomer. Rubin discovered a lot of what is known about dark matter. Nvidia has been naming its architectures after scientists since 1998. It has never explained its naming convention and hasn't emphasized the diversity aspect of its choices, but its names are one of the most visible efforts in the tech industry to honor diversity.\n\ud83d\ude80\nScience & Futuristic Technology\nAnti-aging zealot Bryan Johnson wants to start \u2018foodome sequencing' (3 minute read)\nBryan Johnson, the investor and founder behind the Don't Die movement, wants to start testing as much food as possible to hold brands accountable for unsafe food practices. One of the measures Johnson takes to extend his life is to eat healthy, but he says that eating healthy is not as easy as you'd think as it is hard to buy clean food. Most foods could contain toxins from various processing methods. Johnson plans to create a public database where people can donate money to have certain foods and brands tested for toxins.\nDwarf Lemurs Combat Aging During Hibernation by Reversing Their Cellular Clocks (3 minute read)\nThe fat-tailed dwarf lemur, a hamster-sized primate from Madagascar, is the closest genetic relative to humans known to hibernate. They tend to live longer than expected given their size. New research shows that these small primates can reverse cellular aging. Telomeres in hibernating lemurs grow longer - the lengthening may serve as a protective mechanism against cell damage. Other mammals, including humans, have also exhibited telomere lengthening in response to extreme metabolic states. Understanding the mechanisms behind this phenomenon could pave the way for the development of novel treatments to slow or prevent age-related diseases.\n\ud83d\udcbb\nProgramming, Design & Data Science\nWhat's HR's role when AI changes everything?

While almost a third of web traffic has been migrated to it already, neither HTTP/3 nor QUIC (the protocol beneath it) are included in the standard libraries of any major languages. There are a rare few external libraries for some languages, but all are experimental and/or independent of other core networking APIs. Rollout of HTTP/3 has barely started rolling out to any popular open source tools. Underlying organizational differences are causing a split in technologies on the Internet. The technology is great, but it's a challenge if those benefits are not evenly distributed and only accessible to a small set of organizations and their customers.\nBeware tech career advice from old heads (2 minute read)\nPeople new to tech should take career advice from people who have been in the industry for more than a decade with enormous skepticism. The options available to people with established careers are dramatically different from what newcomers experience. These differences are so huge that newcomers and experienced workers might as well be in totally different industries. The tech industry of 15 or 20 years ago was very different from today.\n\ud83c\udf81\nMiscellaneous\nGoogle Gemini Can Now Use Your Search History to Provide Personalized Responses (1 minute read)\nGoogle Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model can now access users' search histories to provide more personalized information.

But the push for state law exemptions while advocating to restrict open-source rivals comes at an awkward time given heavy criticism over closed-source models and copyright battles.\nTOGETHER WITH TURING\n\ud83e\udd1d\nJoin the Generative AI Gathering at GTC\nThe Rundown\n: Attending GTC next week or Bay Area based?

Central banks worldwide are\nquietly stockpiling gold\nas a hedge against uncertainty, while the US is rethinking what role digital assets will play in government policy and financial reserves moving forward. These aren\u2019t just headlines\u2014they\u2019re signals. The decisions made today will define\nwhere capital flows, how companies operate, and where the next opportunities emerge\n.\nThe Shutdown Showdown Moves Markets\nAt\nmidnight tonight (March 14, 2025), the U.S. government could shut down\n, with Congress failing to agree on a spending bill. The\nRepublican-led House passed a funding extension, but Senate Democrats are holding firm\n, citing concerns over spending cuts and executive power. The impact is already showing:\nThe\nSPX ( \u25bc 1.39% )\nis down\n10%\nfrom highs, officially entering correction territory.\nThe\nNASDAQ ( 0.0% )\nhas plunged nearly\n2%,\nwith tech stocks leading losses.\nThe\nDOW ( \u25b2 1.34% )\nis down\n1.3% (about 550 points)\namid investor concerns over economic stability.\nWhile previous shutdowns have been\ninconvenient but manageable\n, this one is different.\nIt\u2019s happening against the backdrop of a fragile economy, a tightening Federal Reserve, and mounting global tensions.\nOne irony is that some Democrats fear that if they shut down the government, the president is the person who decides what is essential\u2026 so you are actually\ngiving him even more power\n, and that it \u201cleaves\nElon Musk alone in the candy store\n,\u201d to enact more\nDOGE\ncost-cutting efforts. It seems Dems have a pretty stark choice to make.\nTrump\u2019s Bitcoin Gambit: A Turning Point for Crypto?\nIn an unprecedented move,\nPresident Trump\nsigned an\nexecutive\norder on\nMarch 7\ncreating\nthe\nStrategic Bitcoin Reserve\n, a government-held stockpile of\n200,000\nBTC.X ( \u25bc 0.66% )\n($17.5 billion)\nsourced from\nseized assets\n.\nSupporters argue\nthis signals that\nBitcoin is now a legitimate government-backed asset\n, potentially setting the stage for mainstream institutional adoption, but some lawmakers and market analysts aren\u2019t so sure.\nCritics\n, however\nwarn\nthat\nTrump\u2019s control over a massive BTC reserve\ncould be a political tool, with some Democrats launching a\ncongressional probe\ninto the potential for market manipulation.\nInvestors are also split\nover\nbroader crypto policy questions\n; If the U.S. is holding crypto, does that mean future regulations will be friendlier? Or will this lead to more centralization as the government establishes dominance over digital finance, or a de-facto CBDC by controlling private markets?\nGrok\u2019s AI-Meme Coin Explosion\nAs Washington wrestles with\ninstitutional crypto reserves\n, the private sector is seeing its own\nchaotic crypto experiment unfold\n\u2014this time, thanks to AI. The\nGrok AI\nwas prompted by traders to launch\n17 meme coins\non\nBankrbot\n, an AI\ncrypto automation\ntool on X. The most successful,\nDebtReliefBot (DRB)\n, hit a\n$40 million market cap\nbefore dropping to\n$15 million\n, with\nGrok\n\u2019s\nassociated wallet\naccumulating over\n$600,000\nin transaction fees from trading volume despite the\nxAI\nteam having nothing to do with the tokens.\nBankrbot\nhas since\ndisabled Grok\u2019s\nability to create new tokens, but it seems we have an answer to the question, can\nAI accidentally create financial instruments\nor\nwas it just a memecoin\n? AI-driven financial automation has flown under the radar, but Grok\u2019s incident may\nforce regulators to act\n.\nIf AI can move markets, we\u2019re entering a new era of\nalgorithmic influence\nover\nfinance\n, with all the risks and rewards that come with it.\nThe Trade War Continues\nAn even\nbigger economic story\nis unfolding in international trade.\nOn March 12, Trump\nimposed\n25% tariffs\non\nsteel and aluminum\nimports, citing the need to protect domestic industries.\nThe EU retaliated with tariffs on U.S. goods, including a 50% tax\non\nUS whiskey.\nOn March 13, Trump e\nscalated, threatening a\n200%\ntariff on\nEuropean wine\nif the EU doesn\u2019t back down.\nThe result? Market turbulence, higher costs for manufacturers, and potential\nglobal supply chain disruptions\nthat could impact everything from\nAI chips\nto\nelectric vehicle production\n.\nEconomic analysts at\nUBS\nand\nDeutsche Bank\nwarn that rising trade barriers could\ndeepen the stock market correction\nalready in progress. For investors, this means:\nTech hardware companies may face higher production costs\n, making supply chain diversification more urgent.\nCrypto could see inflows from investors seeking assets outside of government-controlled systems.\nVCs should expect startups in manufacturing and AI hardware to rethink sourcing strategies\namid the escalating tariff war.\nThe Flight to Hard Assets: Gold Surges\nWith markets under stress, central banks are\ndoubling down on gold as a hedge against economic instability.\nOver 1,000 tons\nof gold were added to\nglobal reserves\nin 2024.\nChina\u2019s\ngold reserves hit a\nrecord 2,290 tons\nin February 2025.\nGold prices\nhave surged to an\nall-time high of $2,940\nper ounce.\nThis\nmirrors the growing interest in Bitcoin as a \"digital gold\" alternative\n. While Bitcoin\u2019s volatility in market downturns remains a concern, the\nparallels\nbetween\ngold accumulation\nand\ncrypto adoption\nhighlight a broader shift toward decentralized and government-independent stores of value.\nWhat Comes Next?\nFor\ntech investors, founders, and finance professionals\n, the coming months will be\ndefined\nby volatility (possibly in the shape of a\ndeep recession\nor\ncrash\n), and shift regulation in crypto and finance. 2025 is shaping up to be\na year of structural change\nin both traditional and digital markets.

Central banks worldwide are **quietly stockpiling gold** as a hedge against uncertainty, while the US is rethinking what role digital assets will play in government policy and financial reserves moving forward. These aren\u2019t just headlines\u2014they\u2019re signals. The decisions made today will define **where capital flows, how companies operate, and where the next opportunities emerge**.\r\n\r\n#### The Shutdown Showdown Moves Markets\r\n\r\nAt **midnight tonight (March 14, 2025), the U.S. government could shut down**, with Congress failing to agree on a spending bill. The **Republican-led House passed a funding extension, but Senate Democrats are holding firm**, citing concerns over spending cuts and executive power. The impact is already showing:\r\n\r\n* The** **SPX ( - 1.39% )\r\n** **is down **10% **from highs, officially entering correction territory.\r\n\r\n* **The **NASDAQ ( 0.0% )\r\n has plunged nearly** 2%, **with tech stocks leading losses.\r\n\r\n* **The **DOW ( + 1.34% )\r\n is down **1.3% (about 550 points) **amid investor concerns over economic stability.\r\n\r\nWhile previous shutdowns have been **inconvenient but manageable**, this one is different. **It\u2019s happening against the backdrop of a fragile economy, a tightening Federal Reserve, and mounting global tensions.** One irony is that some Democrats fear that if they shut down the government, the president is the person who decides what is essential\u2026 so you are actually **giving him even more power**, and that it \u201cleaves **Elon Musk alone in the candy store**,\u201d to enact more **DOGE **cost-cutting efforts. It seems Dems have a pretty stark choice to make.\r\n\r\n#### Trump\u2019s Bitcoin Gambit: A Turning Point for Crypto?\r\n\r\nIn an unprecedented move, **President Trump **signed an **executive **order on **March 7 **creating** **the **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve**, a government-held stockpile of **200,000 **BTC.X ( - 0.66% )\r\n** ($17.5 billion)** sourced from **seized assets**. **Supporters argue** this signals that **Bitcoin is now a legitimate government-backed asset**, potentially setting the stage for mainstream institutional adoption, but some lawmakers and market analysts aren\u2019t so sure. \r\n\r\n**Critics**, however** **warn that **Trump\u2019s control over a massive BTC reserve** could be a political tool, with some Democrats launching a **congressional probe** into the potential for market manipulation. **Investors are also split **over **broader crypto policy questions**; If the U.S. is holding crypto, does that mean future regulations will be friendlier? Or will this lead to more centralization as the government establishes dominance over digital finance, or a de-facto CBDC by controlling private markets?\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n#### Grok\u2019s AI-Meme Coin Explosion\r\n\r\nAs Washington wrestles with **institutional crypto reserves**, the private sector is seeing its own **chaotic crypto experiment unfold**\u2014this time, thanks to AI. The **Grok AI **was prompted by traders to launch** 17 meme coins** on **Bankrbot**, an AI **crypto automation** tool on X. The most successful, **DebtReliefBot (DRB)**, hit a **$40 million market cap** before dropping to **$15 million**, with **Grok**\u2019s **associated wallet **accumulating over **$600,000** in transaction fees from trading volume despite the **xAI** team having nothing to do with the tokens. \r\n\r\n**Bankrbot **has since **disabled Grok\u2019s **ability to create new tokens, but it seems we have an answer to the question, can **AI accidentally create financial instruments **or** was it just a memecoin**? AI-driven financial automation has flown under the radar, but Grok\u2019s incident may **force regulators to act**.** **If AI can move markets, we\u2019re entering a new era of **algorithmic influence **over** finance**, with all the risks and rewards that come with it.\r\n\r\n#### The Trade War Continues\r\n\r\nAn even **bigger economic story** is unfolding in international trade.\r\n\r\n* **On March 12, Trump **imposed **25% tariffs **on **steel and aluminum **imports, citing the need to protect domestic industries.\r\n\r\n* **The EU retaliated with tariffs on U.S. goods, including a 50% tax **on **US whiskey.**\r\n\r\n* **On March 13, Trump e**scalated, threatening a **200% **tariff on **European wine **if the EU doesn\u2019t back down.\r\n\r\nThe result? Market turbulence, higher costs for manufacturers, and potential **global supply chain disruptions** that could impact everything from **AI chips **to **electric vehicle production**.\r\n\r\nEconomic analysts at **UBS **and **Deutsche Bank **warn that rising trade barriers could **deepen the stock market correction** already in progress. For investors, this means:\r\n\r\n* **Tech hardware companies may face higher production costs**, making supply chain diversification more urgent.\r\n\r\n* **Crypto could see inflows from investors seeking assets outside of government-controlled systems.**\r\n\r\n* **VCs should expect startups in manufacturing and AI hardware to rethink sourcing strategies** amid the escalating tariff war.\r\n\r\n#### The Flight to Hard Assets: Gold Surges\r\n\r\nWith markets under stress, central banks are **doubling down on gold as a hedge against economic instability.**\r\n\r\n* **Over 1,000 tons **of gold were added to** global reserves** in 2024.\r\n\r\n* **China\u2019s **gold reserves hit a **record 2,290 tons** in February 2025.\r\n\r\n* **Gold prices **have surged to an **all-time high of $2,940** per ounce.\r\n\r\nThis **mirrors the growing interest in Bitcoin as a \"digital gold\" alternative**. While Bitcoin\u2019s volatility in market downturns remains a concern, the **parallels** between **gold accumulation **and **crypto adoption **highlight a broader shift toward decentralized and government-independent stores of value.\r\n\r\n#### What Comes Next?\r\n\r\nFor **tech investors, founders, and finance professionals**, the coming months will be **defined **by volatility (possibly in the shape of a **deep recession** or **crash**), and shift regulation in crypto and finance. 2025 is shaping up to be **a year of structural change** in both traditional and digital markets. Those who adapt quickly to the new realities will be best positioned to thrive.\r\n\r\n\u201c_**\u201c**_**Making AI cheaper \u2013 and not just bigger or better \u2013 is far more impactful to the rest of the world, something that tech leaders in their cloistered bubbles have failed to appreciate.
